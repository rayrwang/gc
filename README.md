Objective-free, modular, feedback neural networks that learn via association.

(*Disclaimer: Very rough/early/speculative work*)

## Install and Run

Install the Python packages in `requirements.txt` using your favorite package manager.

Run the main network:
```
python main.py
```
This should open a debugger GUI window.

Run the smaller testing network:
```
python simple_nets.py
```

## Roadmap

Right now it kind of sucks, need to make it "actually be good":
- Learn useful representations
	- Of perceptual input, goals, and actions
	- Models of self, other agents, and the world
	- Language
	- Abstract ideas
- Interact intelligently with environments
	- Explore and learn
	- Plan and pursue goals
- Think and be creative 😬
